## Introduction

NoteableLinks is a public platform designed to democratize knowledge sharing. It allows users to share informative links, tag them according to topics, and enhance them with personal notes, memos, or reviews. Every link undergoes admin verification to maintain the quality and credibility of the shared resources. View and click counts for each link offer additional insights into the content's reach and impact.
